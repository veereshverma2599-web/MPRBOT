Unfortunately, I’m still encountering issues that are affecting accurate time logging.

For example, on Tuesday, April 29, I was able to log hours successfully for Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. However, I was unable to enter any time for Monday or Tuesday.

The issue appears to be this: when I enter 8 hours for Monday, the system occasionally—but not consistently—records 16 hours instead. This overage then prevents me from entering any hours for Tuesday. As of now, I’m unable to log any time for Tuesday, April 15, and will leave it blank until the issue is resolved.

To help illustrate the issue, I’ve attached the following screenshots:

Sample_Screenshot_Unable_to_enter_time.png – shows the system preventing time entry for Tuesday.

No_Time_Entered_for_Monday_and_yet_8_Hours.png – shows that Monday, April 14, already reflects 8 hours, even though I haven’t logged any time yet.

16_Hours_Recorded_for_Monday_April_14_After_Log.png – shows that after logging my actual 8 hours, the total for Monday jumped to 16 hours.

This same issue occurred on Monday, April 7, where 8 hours had already been recorded (not entered by me and not mapped to any project). Based on my prior experience with this bug, I anticipate that entering my hours will again result in a total of 16 hours. I have held off entering anything for that day to avoid compounding the issue.",Error Entering Time Sheets - Mondays and Tuesdays

While creating a new incident on MyPortal, the case is automatically assigned to my manager by default, even when a different user is selected. Additionally, if I try to update the ""Assigned To"" field after the case is created, the change does not take effect, no error is shown, but the case still remains assigned to my manager.
